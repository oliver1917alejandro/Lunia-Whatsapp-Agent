# Module 1: Introduction to Programming and Python

## 1.1 What is Programming?

Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. These instructions are written in a programming language, which is a formal language that computers can understand.

Think of it like writing a recipe for a computer. The recipe lists the ingredients (data) and the steps (instructions) to follow to achieve a desired outcome (e.g., bake a cake, calculate a sum, display a message).

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Algorithm:** A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.
*   **Source Code:** The human-readable instructions written by a programmer.
*   **Compiler/Interpreter:** A program that translates source code into machine code (binary instructions) that the computer's processor can execute. Python is an interpreted language.
*   **Program:** The executable file or set of files that the computer runs.

**Why Learn Programming?**

*   **Problem Solving:** Develops logical thinking and problem-solving skills.
*   **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks.
*   **Innovation:** Create new software, websites, games, and applications.
*   **Career Opportunities:** High demand for programmers in various industries.
