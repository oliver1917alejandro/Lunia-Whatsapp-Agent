# 4.4 LangGraph vs. LangChain Chains

While both LangChain "Chains" and LangGraph "Graphs" are used to orchestrate sequences of operations involving LLMs, they are suited for different types of applications.

**LangChain Chains (Sequential Execution):**

*   **Structure:** Primarily designed for **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**. This means the flow of execution is linear or branches, but it doesn't typically loop back on itself in a stateful way.
*   **State Management:** While some chains have memory, state management is often implicit or handled by specific memory components within a linear flow. It's not as explicit or flexible as LangGraph's shared state object.
*   **Control Flow:** Control flow is generally determined by the predefined sequence of the chain (e.g., `SequentialChain`) or simple routing logic (`RouterChain`). Complex conditional looping is harder to implement directly.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Simple question-answering.
    *   Summarization.
    *   Extraction.
    *   Basic tool usage where the sequence is known.
    *   Querying data sources and then processing the results.
    *   `LLMChain` for single LLM calls with a prompt.
    *   `SequentialChain` for pipelining outputs to inputs.

**LangGraph (Cyclical and Stateful Execution):**

*   **Structure:** Explicitly designed to create **cyclical graphs**. This means you can easily define loops, retries, and more complex, state-driven flows.
*   **State Management:** Features a **shared, explicit State object** (defined via `TypedDict` or Pydantic `BaseModel`) that can be read from and written to by any node in the graph. This makes managing complex, evolving state across multiple steps much cleaner.
*   **Control Flow:** Offers fine-grained control through **conditional edges**. Nodes (or rather, functions associated with edges) can decide where to go next based on the current state, allowing for highly dynamic and adaptive behavior.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   **Agentic Behavior:** Building sophisticated agents that need to plan, use tools, observe results, and re-plan in a loop until a goal is met. This is a primary use case for LangGraph.
    *   **Multi-Agent Systems:** Orchestrating conversations or collaborations between multiple specialized agents, where each agent might modify a shared state.
    *   **Human-in-the-Loop:** Implementing workflows where the graph pauses for human input or approval at certain points. The human's feedback can alter the state and subsequent flow.
    *   **Iterative Processes:** Applications that refine a result over multiple steps, like iterative document generation, code correction, or complex problem-solving that requires trial and error.
    *   **Robust Error Handling and Retries:** Implementing complex retry logic based on the state of the application (e.g., incrementing a retry counter in the state).

**Analogy:**

*   **LangChain Chains:** Like following a recipe step-by-step. You might have a side-step (a router chain deciding which recipe variation to follow), but generally, you move forward through a predefined path.
*   **LangGraph:** Like a dynamic project plan or a video game with multiple possible paths and outcomes. Your next action (node) depends on the current situation (the shared State object) and decisions made along the way (conditional edges). You can revisit previous stages or loop through tasks until a condition is met.

**When to Choose Which:**

*   **Start with LangChain Chains:** For many LLM applications, especially those with a clear, sequential, or simply branched flow, standard LangChain chains (like `LLMChain`, `SequentialChain`, or even agent executors if the agent logic itself is fairly linear) are often simpler to implement and manage.
*   **Move to LangGraph when you need:**
    *   **Cycles/Loops:** If your application needs to repeat steps, iterate on a solution, or re-evaluate based on new information in a loop.
    *   **Explicit, Shared, Modifiable State:** If you have a complex state that needs to be passed around and modified by many different components in a non-linear fashion, and where the state itself dictates the flow.
    *   **Dynamic, Conditional Routing based on Full State:** If the next step in your process is highly dependent on the entire current state and requires complex decision-making logic that isn't just a simple routing choice.
    *   **Fine-grained control over agent loops:** While LangChain has agent executors, LangGraph allows you to explicitly define the graph that an agent operates within, giving you more control over its internal thought-action-observation loop.

LangGraph doesn't replace LangChain; it extends it for these more complex, stateful, and cyclical scenarios. You'll often use LangChain components (like `LLMChain`, tool wrappers, or even pre-built LangChain agents) *as nodes* within your LangGraph. This allows you to leverage the power of LangChain's building blocks within a more flexible and controllable graph structure.
