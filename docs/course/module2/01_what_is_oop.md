# Module 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals

## 2.1 What is Object-Oriented Programming?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

Think of OOP as organizing your code in a way that mirrors how things work in the real world. For example, a "car" is an object. It has:
*   **Attributes:** color, brand, model, speed, fuel level.
*   **Methods (actions it can perform):** start_engine(), accelerate(), brake(), turn_left().

**Core Principles of OOP:**

OOP is built around several key principles that help create more structured, reusable, and maintainable code:

1.  **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit (an object). This helps in data hiding, where the internal state of an object is protected from outside access.
2.  **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. This simplifies interaction with the object.
3.  **Inheritance:** Allowing a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and creates a hierarchy of classes.
4.  **Polymorphism:** Allowing objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways. The term means "many forms."

**Why Use OOP?**

*   **Modularity:** Code is organized into objects, making it easier to manage and understand.
*   **Reusability:** Objects and classes can be reused in different parts of a program or in other programs (thanks to inheritance).
*   **Maintainability:** Changes to one part of the code are less likely to affect other parts, making it easier to update and fix bugs.
*   **Scalability:** OOP designs tend to be easier to scale as projects grow in complexity.
*   **Real-world Modeling:** OOP allows developers to model real-world entities and their interactions more intuitively.

Python is an object-oriented programming language, and these concepts are fundamental to writing effective Python code, especially for larger applications. We will explore each of these principles in detail in the upcoming sections.
